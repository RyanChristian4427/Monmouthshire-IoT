# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

* Redundancy – The data needs to be stored locally as well as sent to the cloud for storage
* The equipment should be easy to set up out of the box for someone with limited technical capability (non-developer experience)
* Visualisations should be possible of (each user individually – there is never a need to see more than one user at a time):
* Every individual room with all sensors.
* Every sensor with all the rooms together.
* Individual Room with Individual Sensor
* In terms of the sensor readings, instead of polling we only need to detect changes based on a threshold that can be adjusted in the management portal.
* There needs to be some social interaction via sms. Each user will have their own number and a message will be sent and read via ‘voice to SMS’. Appropriate time and means to deliver the spoken message to the user should be given. The user will then be able to reply to the message using voice to speech.
* The user should be able to play using voice activation a quiz.
* Each user can be assigned to many carers.
* Each user can be assigned to many care workers.
* Each user can see their own data if they wish using the same interface.
* The data transfer must be secure.

## Non-Functional Requirements

* Well documented code.
* Attractive interface to look at and easy to read visualisations (negotiated with the principal investigators).

## Data Requirements

* Quiz Questions – selection of different genres.
