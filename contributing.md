# Contributing MD

* If you want your branch merged, make a request before 5pm on a Sunday
* Gitlab boards
* Try to show up
* Follow git-flow.md
* Test where you can, it will save our sanity
* Let the team know if you can't make it in. This way, the team can get started working right away, and won't hold off starting, waiting for you to arrive.
* Try to work throughout the week, and commit often; don't do loads of work without any commits, as it's hard for the team the gauge progress.
* If you're stuck on something critical, ask for help, and ask earlier than you think you'd need to.
* Be nice please
