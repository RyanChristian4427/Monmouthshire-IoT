# Contributing MD

* If you want your branch merged, make a request before 5pm on a Sunday
* Gitlab boards
* Try to show up
* Follow git-flow.md
* Tests (maybe? your definitions seem super arbitrary)
* If you're gonna skip, tell the team
* Try to work throughout the week, and commit often; don't do loads of work without any commits, as it's hard for the team the gauge progress otherwise
* Ryan is the lord your god.
* Be nice please
