# IoT Team 3 React Client

This is the front end client for our IoT data gathering application. This project aims to increase the safety of the elderly along with combating social isolation. As of now, this front end is merely used as a display for the data gathered so patterns can be easily found in the lifestyles of the elderly that it is monitoring.

The front end for this project is written in React, a library used to for building user interfaces. Every component and helper file is written using TypeScript, and this project utilizes the Bulma SCSS framework.

This React client will be updated in conjunction with the Express API server.
