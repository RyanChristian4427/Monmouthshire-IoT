# IOT for Behavioural Tracking and Social Inclusion.

## Scope and Aims
The project falls under the category of Internet of Things and automated assistive independent living. The project will utilise IOT and open source, commercially available frameworks, languages
 and tools to prototype a functioning solution.
 
 The main aim of the project will be to:
  * Show feasibility of using off the shelf equipment to set up a bespoke IOT environment (in this specific scenario an area of residence).
  * Show the feasibility of having a control panel to monitor the signals received by a controller.
  * Show efficacy of applying machine learning to understand signals and outliers (thresholds for anomalies) in real time.
  * Show a scalable path to increasing case study to multiple homes. 
  * Connecting the home interface to social media accounts in order to show examples of how we could, using the already installed technology, decrease social exclusion. 
 
## Project Description
This project will use emerging technologies to improve social interaction for people with the aim of reducing loneliness whilst alleviating digital exclusion in the rural communities of Wales. We will target the use of ubiquitous technology rather than attempt to force digital adoption to users. The technologies support the ‘Aging in Place’ initiative [7] which encourages older people to “continue living in their own home”, overcoming disabilities and other preventative factors such as loneliness.

Specifically, the project will aim to use affordable technology such as Raspberry Pi’s to integrate ubiquitously into the HDMI slot of a user’s Television Unit and use voice interaction to communicate with the user. The product will then use artificial intelligence algorithms to engage the user and assist in battling social exclusion, rather than simply acting as a ‘dumb’ assistant waiting for input from the user before taking any action. 

### Example scenarios are: 
  * (Social Inclusion): The system would be able to connect to social media and increase communication with friends and family, as well as social media happenings effortlessly. The system would for example ask: “There is a new video on The Beatles”, would you like to watch it? “Your Friend (x) just posted something online, would you like to see it?” “Would you like to send a recorded hello to your son/daughter
 for their birthday?”
 
  * (IOT Sensor Readings): The use of IoT sensors in and around the home that could provide a “remote carer” with daily statistics that measure and track metrics like movement and activities e.g. how many times the kettle has been boiled or
 the fridge door has been opened, lights switched on etc. Such metrics can provide the first early indications that something has gone wrong, such as the elderly person having fallen or been taken ill.
 
  * (Nutrition for Energy and Feel-good Factor): If the project progresses faster than anticipated, we plan to also ask for ‘feel good’ cues. This includes Asking the user how lunch was and what they had. The algorithm will then analyse the food and suggest options for the individual to compliment anything they are lacking or perhaps some thoughts for a balanced dinner in the evening. This particular method is also shown to reduce and tackle the disease of depression which is often brought about by loneliness [8], [9]. 

  
Upon the completion of the working prototype, we will analyse the data received from the pilot. Our architecture will be scalable to deploy the platform to many houses and elicit data from a larger concurrent user pool. We will verify the successful deployment by a further 10 times factor. The supercomputer we have access to gives us the capability to continue the project to this scale. 

In terms of the initial plan for this specific project we offer the following three deliverables:
  * Feasibility study suggesting the architecture from a functional, non-functional and data perspective
  * Minimum Viable Product Report on the pilot study
  * Testing Plan
